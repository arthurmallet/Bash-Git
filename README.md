# D-Lab's Bash and Git Workshop

This repository contains the materials for D-Labâ€™s Bash and Git workshop, a fast
introduction to using the terminal for `git`. No prior experience in either Bash
or Git is necessary.

## Workshop Goals

In this workshop, we provide an introduction to using bash, the Bourne-Again
Shell, which is used to interact with your computer via a terminal, and `git`, a
version control software. This workshop is designed to provide a fast (3 hours)
introduction to both these topics.

## Installation Instructions

You'll need to make sure `git` is installed on your system. General instructions
are available on [Github](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).

* **Windows:** You can install `git` via [git for
  Windows](https://gitforwindows.org).
* **Mac:** It is very likely `git` should already come installed with your Mac.
  You can open a terminal and run `git version` to make sure. If it's not
  installed, you can install it using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).
* **Linux:** You can use whatever package management system your distribution
  uses to install `git`. For Debian/Ubuntu, this is `apt`. For Fedora, this will
  be `dnf`.

Once `git` is installed on your computer, open up the Markdown file
`lessons/01_getting_started.md` to create a Github account and set up
authentication tokens. Then, we'll download these materials using a `git clone`
step.

## Is Bash or Git not Working on Your Computer?

If you do not have `git` installed and the materials loaded on your workshop by
the time it starts, you can use the UC Berkeley Datahub to run the materials for
these lessons. You can access the DataHub by clicking [this
link](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdlab-berkeley%2FBash-Git&urlpath=tree%2FBash-Git%2F&branch=main).

The DataHub downloads this repository, along with any necessary packages, and
allows you to run the materials in an RStudio instance on UC Berkeley's servers.
No installation is necessary from your end - you only need an internet browser
and a CalNet ID to log in. By using the DataHub, you can save your work and come
back to it at any time. When you want to return to your saved work, just go
straight to [DataHub](https://datahub.berkeley.edu), sign in, and you click on
the `Bash-Git` folder.
